# MSc Thesis Scripts
Scripts for my MSc thesis. Data downloaded as NetCDF files from Copernicus [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels) and [ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means). 

The data were prepared with the scripts in [data_preprocessing](https://github.com/Giulia-Sg/Thesis/tree/main/data_preprocessing). 

The functions used in the analyses are in [thesis_functions.py](https://github.com/Giulia-Sg/Thesis/blob/main/thesis_functions.py). 

The analyses are in [PV_potential.py](https://github.com/Giulia-Sg/Thesis/blob/main/PV_potential.py), [wind_potential.py](https://github.com/Giulia-Sg/Thesis/blob/main/wind_potential.py), [complementarity.py](https://github.com/Giulia-Sg/Thesis/blob/main/complementarity.py).
